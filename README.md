# identifying-subscription-clients
In order to identify which clients were most likely to subscribe to subscription packages, the main model relied on cosine similarity to compare characteristics of current subscription clients to non-subscription clients. Some features for the model include: location, average cost per visit, time per visit, average days between visit, span of days since first and last non-subscription clean, primary type of clean, and primary window washer. The end result was a list of 20 clients with above 95% similarity (>.90 cosine) to subscription clients.
In addition, this notebook also includes (1) an assessment of which services generated the most revenue per visit and overall, (2) an assessment of the efficiency of window washers, and (3) viewing the geographical spread of client base.
